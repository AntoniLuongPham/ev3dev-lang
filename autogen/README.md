# Autogen scripts for ev3dev language bindings

## Usage
To use the script, make sure that you have cloned the repo and `cd`d in to the autogen directory. Make sure that you have Node.JS and `npm` installed.
If you have not yet done so, run `npm install` to update the dependencies for auto-generation. Then you can re-generate all files by running `node autogen.js` on a Windows system or `nodejs autogen.js` on most Linux distros.

## How it works
